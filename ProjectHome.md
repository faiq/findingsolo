This is a Matlab project to implement a basic red solo cup image detection program. It uses a combination of color thresholding, shape detection, and prototype matching algorithms. The program is still in development and requires significant improvements especially with edge detection and shape based processing. Please feel free to use the code as you like. And let us know if you make any significant improvements!
